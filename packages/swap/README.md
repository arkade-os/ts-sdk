# @arkade-os/swap

Maker-side [Arkade Intents](https://arkade.money) atomic swaps: discover markets, quote and
validate, create offers, track them, cancel them, and rebuild the whole record set from chain after
a wallet restore. Framework-free TypeScript over `@arkade-os/sdk`: the core API and
`InMemoryAssetSwapRepository` use no DOM and no Node-specific APIs, so they run in Node, the
browser, and React Native alike. `IndexedDbAssetSwapRepository` is the one exception — it needs a
platform-provided or polyfilled IndexedDB.

## The four layers

1. **`offer`** — the swap covenant itself. Two program JSONs (want-BTC / want-asset), the
   `Offer` type, the TLV wire codec (`encodeOffer`/`decodeOffer`, `OFFER_PACKET_TYPE`), address
   derivation (`offerVtxoScript`), and the maker operations `createOffer`/`cancelOffer`. Identical
   offers always derive identical swap addresses — the program JSONs are hashed into the address,
   so their bytes are frozen (guarded by a golden test).
2. **`markets`** — solver discovery and pricing guardrails: `discoverMarkets` (1-hour cached
   registry fetch with stale-cache fallback), `findMarket`, `validatePlan` (balance, both-side
   limits, BTC-leg dust), `QUOTE_OPTIONS`, and `makeCachedFeedFetch` for rate-limited price feeds.
3. **`store`** — the persisted `AssetSwap` records (`getAssetSwaps`/`addAssetSwap`/
   `updateAssetSwap`), thin helpers over an `AssetSwapRepository`. Persistence failures never
   throw: by the time a swap is stored its funding tx is broadcast, and everything stays
   recoverable from chain.
4. **`restore`** — `restoreAssetSwaps` rebuilds lost records by scanning sent virtual txs for
   offer packets and binding each funding vtxo to its spend. Incremental: answered txids are
   remembered in the repository (`getScannedTxids`/`markTxidsScanned`) so nothing is fetched
   twice.

Everything the package persists — swap records, the restore-scan cursor, and the markets cache —
goes through a single `AssetSwapRepository`, following the Arkade repository convention
(versioned interface, `AsyncDisposable`, one backend per platform). Two backends ship here:
`InMemoryAssetSwapRepository` and `IndexedDbAssetSwapRepository` (built on the SDK's shared
IndexedDB manager, like the Boltz plugin's repositories). Construct one and pass it wherever the
package asks for a repository; `discoverMarkets` also accepts none, for a one-shot uncached
discovery.

## Creating an offer

Fund the returned address with the side you deposit, embedding the payload, and the solver does
the rest:

```ts
// BTC -> asset
const o = await createOffer(wallet, ARK, EMU, { wantAmount: 1000n, wantAsset });
await wallet.send({ address: o.address, amount: 1000, extensions: [o.extension] });

// asset -> BTC (the sats are the VTXO carrier for the asset)
const o = await createOffer(wallet, ARK, EMU, { wantAmount: 1000n, offerAsset });
await wallet.send({
    address: o.address,
    amount: 500,
    assets: [{ assetId, amount: 1000n }],
    extensions: [o.extension],
});
```

### What `createOffer` gives you back

`createOffer` is pure derivation — it broadcasts nothing. The offer only becomes real when the
deposit lands at `address`.

| Field          | What it is                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`      | The swap address to fund with your deposit. Identical offers derive an identical address, so the **funding txid**, not the address, identifies one deposit. |
| `extension`    | Pass straight to `wallet.send`'s `extensions`. It carries the offer inside the funding tx so the solver can discover the offer from the txid alone. |
| `offerHex`     | The encoded offer. **Persist this** — it is the only input `cancelOffer` needs to rebuild the covenant.                                        |
| `swapPkScript` | The covenant's scriptPubKey: the key an indexer watches to spot the deposit and its later spend.                                               |

The minimum a maker must keep to stay in control of a swap is `offerHex` plus the funding txid.
Everything else — status, amounts, timestamps — `restoreAssetSwaps` rebuilds from chain, and the
offer bytes themselves are recoverable from the funding tx if the record is lost.

## Cancelling an offer no taker filled

```ts
const txid = await cancelOffer(wallet, ARK, swap.offerHex, swap.fundingTxid, swap.swapAddress);
```

**An unfilled offer never expires.** Neither program carries a timelock, so a deposit no taker
picked up sits at the swap address indefinitely — nothing reclaims it for the maker, and there is
no "expired" state to wait for. Cancelling is the only way out, and the maker has to ask.

The two ways out of the covenant are deliberately asymmetric:

- **`fulfill`** is signed by the **server alone**, but the covenant constrains it to pay output 0
  to the maker's script for at least `wantAmount`. A taker cannot take the deposit without
  delivering the other side.
- **`cancel`** is a **2-of-2 of the maker and the server**. Cancelling is cooperative, not a
  unilateral withdrawal.

So cancel *races* a fill rather than pre-empting it. If the solver fills in the same moment,
`cancelOffer` throws `no spendable VTXO at the swap address` — that means the swap **completed**,
not that anything went wrong. Re-read the swap's state before treating it as an error;
`restoreAssetSwaps` tells the two spends apart afterwards and marks the record `fulfilled` rather
than `cancelled`.

Pass `fundingTxid` whenever you have it. Identical offers share an address, so without it cancel
spends whichever deposit is first at that address — not necessarily the one you meant. Every
`AssetSwap` carries the txid, so the call above is the shape to prefer. `swapAddress` pins the
server key the covenant was built with, keeping cancel working across a server signer rotation.
